              <p>Shampoo is arguably your most important haircare product and the foundation for great hair. Here at Shears, we offer a variety of Lanza shampoos so that you can find the hair cleanser that meets your core haircare concern—think sulfate-free shampoo for colored hair, moisturizing shampoo for dry hair, or shampoo for damaged hair—as well as the hair shampoos that help you create different end looks such as volume, shine, or frizz control. And for curly girls, find the best shampoo for your curly hair.

              <p className="quote"><i className="fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"/>&nbsp; As the seasons change, our hair automatically reacts to the weather as well. Frizzy hair in the summer humidity or dry hair in the harsh winter is no good. Koby believes that hair should be treated with the same detail as a designer approaches different types of fabrics. We wouldn’t wash our cashmere clothes the same way as wool or cotton, right? Each fabric will react differently to water temperature, cleansers, and friction. Same is with our hair and product usage!&nbsp; <i className="fa fa-quote-right" aria-hidden="true"/></p>
